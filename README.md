# mLeftwich Portfolio Page
## Challenge for Week 2 - Create an application for potential employers to view your work

This week were were tasked with building a portfolio page from scratch.
This is an application/website that showcases our previous work/experience and also details about ourselves, how to contact and other relevant information.

The portfolio was to have a recent photograph, an about section, samples of our work and as said before how to contact.

The porfolio also needed to be functioning in a way wherin upon using a link the browser automatically scrolled to the appropriate section of the page.

The first application was to be the main focus of the showcase, appearing larger than the rest of the work shown.
All the examples were to provide an image/preview of the application, which would redirect you to the deployed project.

Finally, the portfolio needs to be accessible across all platforms, adjusting accordingly when viewed either on a phone, laptop, or tablet.

You can view the deployed application [here](https://mleftwich.github.io/mLeftwich/)

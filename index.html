        <div id="about">
          <p>
            My name is Matt Leftwich, I'm a developing web developer. I started
            my journey with web development way back in 2003 or so, at age 13.
            What started initially as a desire to create interesting
            functionality in the web based chat client mIRC turned into an all
            round passion for code and development.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Beginning on mIRC turned out to be quite fortuitous, as I was
            exposed to like minded people that shared a similar interest in web
            design and was able to continue my self-taught practice with the
            support of knowledgable and passionate individuals.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I carry this same drive and focus with me today as I embark on a new
            chapter along my development odyssey; an invigorating new challenge
            in the guise of a Web Development Bootcamp through Trilogy Education
            and the University of Western Australia, where I aim to broaden my
            skillset and hopefully build a life around something that I've
            always been keenly interested in.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The internet is an ever evolving machine, and as such developers
            need to be on the cusp of the relevant technologies used to interact
            within it. This will be my home to learn, share and experiment with
            the inspiring, and exciting possibilities available online today.

              This is an example of my work from 2005. I was heavily
              experimenting with PhotoShop back then, and had learnt that you
              could create a UI as one picture and "slice" it up into sections,
              using another application called ImageReady.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              This would likely not be considered best practice nowadays, or
              perhaps even back then, and is generally a lazy method as the
              application automatically generated the HTML so it was just a case
              of altering elements to have the desired content, never the less
              the technique did lend itself to a beginner.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              There is no deployed application for this example as it was only a
              prototype at the time, but you can view it and others
              <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/ssd-optix/gallery">here</a>
              and have a laugh at my expense.

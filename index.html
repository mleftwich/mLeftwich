        <div id="about">
          <p>
            My name is Matt Leftwich, I'm a developing web developer. I started
            my journey with web development way back in 2003 or so, at age 13.
            What started initially as a desire to create interesting
            functionality in the web based chat client mIRC turned into an all
            round passion for code and development.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Beginning on mIRC turned out to be quite fortuitous, as I was
            exposed to like minded people that shared a similar interest in web
            design and was able to continue my self-taught practice with the
            support of knowledgable and passionate individuals.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I carry this same drive and focus with me today as I embark on a new
            chapter along my development odyssey; an invigorating new challenge
            in the guise of a Web Development Bootcamp through Trilogy Education
            and the University of Western Australia, where I aim to broaden my
            skillset and hopefully build a life around something that I've
            always been keenly interested in.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The internet is an ever evolving machine, and as such developers
            need to be on the cusp of the relevant technologies used to interact
            within it. This will be my home to learn, share and experiment with
            the inspiring, and exciting possibilities available online today.

            <p>
              This is the result of the first big project I undertook during Bootcamp.
              Also the first time implementing what I had learned through the course,
              in a team of 3 aspiring developers. It was a great way to make use of 
              all the knowledge we had gained and a practical way to show the different
              technologies/languages covered throughout the start of the course. We gained
              a good understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the use of API's.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The application is designed to generate a random recipe based upon
              the users location and the relevant weather conditions in their city.
              When the user first visits the website they are presented with a title,
              a random light-hearted inspiring quote as "food for thought", and a text
              entry field where they can enter their location, then click on a button to generate the result.
              The application generates an icon and provides the current temperature in that area,
              and then produces a recipe dependant on the conditions, i.e. hot or cold.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I enjoyed working with my co-developers Sara and Navneet on this project, we have discussed
              further development for the application such as the ability to save favourite recipes, 
              a more comprehensive library for results, and more food-specific quotes.
              You can view the deployed application
              <a href="https://navneet-birdi.github.io/Inspired-Eats/">here</a>
              and take the guesswork out of cooking today!.

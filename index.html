          <!-- <p>
            My name is Matt Leftwich, I'm a developing web developer. I started
            my journey with web development way back in 2003 or so, at age 13.
            What started initially as a desire to create interesting
            functionality in the web based chat client mIRC turned into an all
            round passion for code and development.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Beginning on mIRC turned out to be quite fortuitous, as I was
            exposed to like minded people that shared a similar interest in web
            design and was able to continue my self-taught practice with the
            support of knowledgable and passionate individuals.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I carry this same drive and focus with me today as I embark on a new
            chapter along my development odyssey; an invigorating new challenge
            in the guise of a Web Development Bootcamp through Trilogy Education
            and the University of Western Australia, where I aim to broaden my
            skillset and hopefully build a life around something that I've
            always been keenly interested in.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The internet is an ever evolving machine, and as such developers
            need to be on the cusp of the relevant technologies used to interact
            within it. This will be my home to learn, share and experiment with
            the inspiring, and exciting possibilities available online today.
